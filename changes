Notes

Getting started with backend: first create mongoose connection by creating mongodb/database folder in lib
& running npm install mongoose/mongodb
then create connection,
then create models

Webhooks in this project was used to create a user as soon as the clerk user is created. It works like onClick,
but for an event that occurs on the server. Svix in this application was used for webhook signature functionality.

The whole point of using webhooks and API routes so far in this project is to sync clerk data with backend
